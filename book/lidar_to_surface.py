# # **LiDAR Point clouds to 3D surfaces** ✨➡️🏔️
#
# In this final tutorial, let's use PyGMT to
# perform a more advanced geoprocessing workflow 😎
#
# Specifically, we'll learn to filter and interpolate
# a LiDAR point cloud onto a regular grid surface 🏁
#
# At the end, we'll also make a 🚠 3D perspective plot for
# the Digital Surface Model (DSM) produced through this exercise!

# %% [markdown]
# ## 🎉 Getting started
#
# Begin by importing some Python 🐍 libraries.
#
# Besides [pygmt](https://www.pygmt.org), we'll also be using:
#
# - [laspy](https://github.com/laspy/laspy) to read in LAZ LiDAR files 🌃
# - [pandas](https://pandas.pydata.org) for managing tabular data 🀤
# - [rioxarray](https://corteva.github.io/rioxarray) to export our DSM to a GeoTIFF 🗺️

# %%
import laspy
import pandas as pd
import pygmt
import rioxarray
import xarray as xr

# # 0️⃣ The LiDAR data
#
# Let's visit [Wellington](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wellington)
# which is the capital city of New Zealand 🇳🇿.
#
# They recently had a LiDAR survey done between March 2019 to March 2020 🛩️,
# with the point cloud and derived products published under an open

# First though, we'll need to download a sample file to play with 🎮
#
# Luckily for us,
# there is a function called [pygmt.which](https://www.pygmt.org/v0.6.1/api/generated/pygmt.which)
# that has to ability to do just that!
#
# The `download=True` option can be used to download ⬇️ a remote file to our local working directory.

# %%
# Download LiDAR LAZ file from a URL
lazfile: str = pygmt.which(
    fname="https://opentopography.s3.sdsc.edu/pc-bulk/NZ19_Wellington/CL2_BQ31_2019_1000_2138.laz",
    download=True,
)
print(lazfile)

# %% [markdown]
# ## Loading a point cloud 🌧️

# %% [markdown]
# Now we can use [laspy](https://laspy.readthedocs.io) to read in our example LAZ file
# into a [pandas.DataFrame](https://pandas.pydata.org/pandas-docs/version/1.4/reference/api/pandas.DataFrame.html).
#
# The data will be kept in a variable called 'df' which stands for dataframe.

# %%
# Load LAZ data into a pandas DataFrame
lazdata = laspy.read(source=lazfile)
df = pd.DataFrame(
    data={
        "x": lazdata.x.scaled_array(),
        "y": lazdata.y.scaled_array(),
        "z": lazdata.z.scaled_array(),
        "classification": lazdata.classification,
    }
)

# ## Quick data preview ⚡

# %% [markdown]
# Let's get the bounding box 📦 region of our study area using
# [pygmt.info](https://www.pygmt.org/v0.6.1/api/generated/pygmt.info.html).

# %%
# Get bounding box region
region: list = pygmt.info(data=df[["x", "y"]], spacing=1)  # West, East, South, North

# More than 7 million points, that's a lot! 🤯
#
# Let's try to take a quick look of our LiDAR elevation points on a map 🗺️
#
# PyGMT *can* plot these many points, but it might take a long time ⏳,
# so let's do a quick filter by taking every
# [n-th row](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/25055712/pandas-every-nth-rowhttps://stackoverflow.com/questions/25055712/pandas-every-nth-row)
# from our dataframe table.

# %%
df_filtered: pd.DataFrame = df.iloc[::20]
print(f"Filtered down to {len(df_filtered)} data points")

# %% [markdown]
# Now we can visualize these quickly on a map with PyGMT 😀

# %%
# Plot XYZ points on a map
fig = pygmt.Figure()
fig.basemap(frame=True, region=region, projection="x1:5000")

    x=df_filtered.x, y=df_filtered.y, color=df_filtered.z, style="c0.03c", cmap=True
)
fig.colorbar(position="JMR", frame=["af+lElevation", "y+lm"])
fig.show()

# It's hard to make out what the objects are,
# but hopefully you'll see what looks like a wharf with ⛵ boats on the top left corner.
#
# This is showing us a part of Oriental Bay in Wellington,
# with Mount Victoria ⛰️ towards the Southeast corner of the map.

# # 1️⃣ Creating a Digital Surface Model (DSM)
#
# Let's now produce a digital surface model from our point cloud 🌧️
#
# We'll first do some proper spatial data cleaning 🧹 using both
# [pandas](https://pandas.pydata.org) and [pygmt](https://www.pygmt.org).

# %% [markdown]
# First step is to remove the LiDAR points classified as high noise 🔊
# which is done by querying all the points that are not '18'.
#
# 🔖 References:
# - Table 17 of [ASPRS LAS Specification](https://www.asprs.org/a/society/committees/standards/LAS_1_4_r13.pdf)

# %%
df: pd.DataFrame = df.query(expr="classification != 18")

# %% [markdown]
# ## Get highest elevation points 🍫

# %% [markdown]
# Next, we'll use the
# [blockmedian](https://www.pygmt.org/v0.6.1/api/generated/pygmt.blockmedian.html)
# function to trim 🪒 down the points spatially.
#
# By default, this function computes a single median elevation
# for every pixel on an equally spaced grid 🏁
#
# For a Digital **Surface** Elevation Model (DSM) though,
# we should pick the highest elevation 🔝 instead of the median.
#
# So we'll tell blockmedian to use the 99th
# [quantile](https://docs.generic-mapping-tools.org/latest/blockmedian.html#t) (T) instead,
# and set our output grid spacing to be exactly 1 metre (1+e) 📏
#
# Note that we'll only be taking the 🇽, 🇾, 🇿 (elevation) columns for this.

# %%
# Preprocess LiDAR data using blockmedian
df_trimmed: pd.DataFrame = pygmt.blockmedian(
    data=df[["x", "y", "z"]],
    T=0.99,  # 99th quantile, i.e. the highest point
    spacing="1+e",
    region=region,
)
df_trimmed

# %% [markdown]
# ## Turn points into a grid 🫓

# %% [markdown]
# Lastly, we'll use [pygmt.surface](https://www.pygmt.org/v0.6.1/api/generated/pygmt.surface.html)
# to produce a grid from the 🇽, 🇾, 🇿 data points.
#
# Make sure to set our desired grid spacing to be exactly 📏 1 metre (1+e) again.
#
# Also, we'll set a tension factor (T) of 0.35 which is suitable for steep topography
# (since we have some 🏠 buildings with 'steep' vertical edges).
#
# 🚨 Note that this might take some time to run.

# %%
# Create a Digital Surface Elevation Model with
# a spatial resolution of 1m.
grid: xr.DataArray = pygmt.surface(
    x=df_trimmed.x,
    y=df_trimmed.y,
    z=df_trimmed.z,
    spacing="1+e",
    region=region,  # xmin, xmax, ymin, ymax
    T=0.35,  # tension factor
)

# %% [markdown]
# Let's take a look 👀 at the grid output.
#
# The grid will be returned as an
# [xarray.DataArray](https://docs.xarray.dev/en/v2022.03.0/generated/xarray.DataArray.html),
# with each pixel's elevation (🇿 value in metres) stored at every 🇽 and 🇾 coordinate.

# # 2️⃣ Plotting a Digital Surface Model (DSM)

# %% [markdown]
# ## **Plot in 2D** 🏳️‍🌈
#
# Now we can plot our Digital Surface Model (DSM) grid 🏁
#
# This can be done by passing the
# [xarray.DataArray](https://docs.xarray.dev/en/v2022.03.0/generated/xarray.DataArray.html)
# grid into
# [pygmt.Figure.grdimage](https://www.pygmt.org/v0.6.1/api/generated/pygmt.Figure.grdimage).

# %%
fig2 = pygmt.Figure()
fig2.basemap(
    frame=True,
    region=[1_749_760, 1_750_240, 5_426_880, 5_427_600],
    projection="x1:5000",
)
pygmt.makecpt(cmap="bukavu", series=[-10, 200])
fig2.grdimage(grid=grid)
fig2.colorbar(position="JMR", frame=["af+lElevation", "y+lm"])
fig2.show()

# %% [markdown]
# ## Plot 3D perspective view ⛰️
#
# Now comes the cool part 💯
#
# PyGMT has a [grdview](https://pygmt-git-foss4g2019oceania.gmt.now.sh/api/generated/pygmt.Figure.grdview.html#pygmt.Figure.grdview)
# function to make high quality 3D perspective plots of our elevation surface!
#
# Besides providing the elevation 'grid', there are a few basic things to configure:
# - cmap - name of 🌈 [colormap](https://docs.generic-mapping-tools.org/6.3/cookbook/cpts.html#id3) to use
# - surftype - we'll use 's' here which just creates a regular surface 🏄
# - perspective - set azimuth angle (e.g. 315 for NorthWest) and 📐 elevation (e.g 30 degrees) of the viewpoint
# - zscale - a vertical exaggeration 🔺 factor, we'll use 0.02 here

# %%
fig3 = pygmt.Figure()
fig3.grdview(
    grid=grid,
    cmap="bukavu",
    surftype="s",  # surface plot
    perspective=[315, 30],  # azimuth bearing, and elevation angle
    zscale=0.02,  # vertical exaggeration
)
fig3.show()

# %% [markdown]
# There are also other things we can 🧰 configure such as:
#
# - Hillshading ⛱️ using `shading=True`
# - A proper 3D map frame 🖼️ with:
#   - automatic tick marks on x and y axis (e.g. `xaf+lLabel`)
#   - z-axis automatic tick marks (`zaf+lLabel`)
#   - plot title (`+tMy Title`)

# %%
fig3 = pygmt.Figure()
fig3.grdview(
    grid=grid,
    cmap="bukavu",
    surftype="s",  # surface plot
    perspective=[315, 30],  # azimuth bearing, and elevation angle
    zscale=0.02,  # vertical exaggeration
    shading=True,  # hillshading
    frame=[
        'xaf+l"Easting"',
        'yaf+l"Northing"',
        'zaf+l"Elevation (m)"',
        "+tOriental Bay, Wellington",
    ],
)
fig3.show()

# %% [markdown]
# Feel free to have a go at changing the azimuth and elevation angle to get a different view 🔭
#
# You can also try to tweak the vertical exaggeration factor 🗼
# and play around with the map frame!

# %% [markdown]
# ## Save figures and output DSM to GeoTIFF 💾
#
# Time to save your work!
#
# We'll save each of our figures into separate files first 🗃️

# %%
fig.savefig(fname="wellington_1d_lidar.png")
fig2.savefig(fname="wellington_2d_dsm_map.png")
fig3.savefig(fname="wellington_3d_dsm_view.png")

# %% [markdown]
# Also, it'll be good to have a proper GeoTIFF of the DSM we made.
# This can be done using
# [rioxarray's to_raster method](https://corteva.github.io/rioxarray/html/examples/convert_to_raster.html).

# %%
grid.rio.to_raster(raster_path="DSM_of_Wellington.tif")

# %% [markdown]
# The files should now appear on the file list on the left,
# and you can download them to your computer.

# # 3️⃣ Bonus exercise - Create a 3D surface map of another area
#
# Here's a challenge to test your PyGMT skills 🤹
#
# You'll be processing a LiDAR point cloud of a different area 📍 from start to finish.
