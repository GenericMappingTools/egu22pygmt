    "# Making some Mars maps with pygmt\n",
    "\n",
    "This tutorial page covers the basics of creating some maps and 3D plot of Mars (yes! Mars). The idea here is to demonstrate that you can use a simple sequence of commands with PyGMT, a Python wrapper for the Generic Mapping Tools (GMT), and with some public data about the topography of Mars, create your own maps, as well as compare this topography with what we know of our own planet Earth."

Likewise, `perspective=[150,45]` was chosen attempting (it's a matter of taste) and depends of which flank of the volcano you want to show. But this choice has to be made according to `shading` since to give a good 3D impression, the lighting must be adjusted according to the elevation and azimuth of the perspective. Finally, the pen outline is made smooth and small to enhance the contours of the topography.\n",
    "\n",
    "Finally, let's make a combined map showing the planet in an inset in the upper right corner. We use the same bounding box coordinates used to cut out the topography, drawing in red on the map. Obviously here the color scale is the same."
